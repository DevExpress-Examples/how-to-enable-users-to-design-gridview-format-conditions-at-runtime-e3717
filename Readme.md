# How to enable users to design GridView format conditions at runtime


<p>This example demonstrates how to enable users to design GridView format conditions at runtime.</p><p>The illustrated approach is similar to the one shown in the Format Condition example included in the XtraGrid Features Demo.</p><p>(DevExpress 2011.1 Demos\Components\WinForms\XtraGrid\CS\GridMainDemo\Modules\StyleConditions.cs).</p><br />
<p>In this example, we add two additional menu items to the standard popup column menu.</p><p>If the "Simple conditions editor" item is chosen, the SimpleConditionDesigner form is shown.</p><p>This form displays a special controls collection for editing simple GridView format conditions in the same window.</p><br />
<p>If the "Expression conditions editor" item is chosen, the ExpressionConditionDesigner form is shown.</p><p>This form displays a special controls collection for editing expression conditions in the special default dialog box.</p>
